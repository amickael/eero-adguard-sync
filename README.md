## üöÄ Usage
**wipeit** is a command-line program to purge your Reddit history. It requires a Python interpreter version 3.7+.

To authenticate without wiping history you can use the `login` command, a browser window will open prompting you to login to Reddit:
```shell
wipeit login
```
---
To wipe your Reddit history you can use the `wipe` command. The following command will clear the last 30 days of comment and submission history, and will overwrite them with random text before deletion:
```shell
wipeit wipe -d 30 -sco
```
> Note: A browser window will open to request access to your account if you have not previously authenticated.
---
To remove Reddit credentials from your computer you can use the `logout` command:
```shell
wipeit logout
```
